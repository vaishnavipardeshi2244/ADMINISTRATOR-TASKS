#1. Explain the following types of DDoS attacks?
A. The causes of  challenge collapsar attack is to  ditrupt the recievers server,  the second  reason for launching an attack is because they hold a grudge against the target. Many DoS attacks are politically or ideologically motivated, with the attacker holding a grievance against their target. The attack could cost the organisation money if services are disrupted during the attack. Ther third reason maybe exhausting the  resources of targetted webserver.
B. The way to identify the cc attack:
-->The invention discloses a CC (Challenge Collapsar) attack protection method and device. The method comprises the steps of obtaining IP (Internet Protocol) address of a client which initiates a transmission control protocol TCP connection request; determining whether the TCP connection request of the client is a CC attack or not according to the IP address; and rejecting an access of the client if the TCP connection request of the client is the CC attack. According to the technical solution provided by the embodiment of the method and the device, the request initiated by an abnormal client can be recognized and filtered, thereby rejecting the access of the client, reducing the use of server resources and improving a CC attack protection effect.
